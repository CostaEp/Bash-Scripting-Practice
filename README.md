# Bash Scripting Practice

Welcome to my Bash scripting practice repository! This repository contains various Bash scripts that I have created to improve my scripting skills. The scripts are organized into different sections based on their functionality.

## Repository Structure

The repository consists of the following directories:

### 1. `backup_demo`
This folder contains scripts related to backup operations. These scripts demonstrate how to automate file and directory backups using Bash. Examples may include:
- Creating compressed backups using `tar`.
- Scheduling backups with `cron`.
- Copying important files to a secure location.

### 2. `check_site_status_demo`
This folder contains scripts for checking the status of websites. These scripts help monitor site availability and response times. Examples include:
- Checking if a website is online or offline.
- Checking HTTP error codes and response statuses.
